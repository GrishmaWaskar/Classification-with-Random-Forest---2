# Fraud Detection using Random Forest

# Project Objective
- The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent taxable incomes using Random Forest classification.
- The model aims to classify taxpayers into two categories: "Risky" for those with taxable incomes less than or equal to $30,000 and "Good" for others.

# Overview of Project
- This project aims to detect fraudulent taxable incomes using a Random Forest classifier.
- It preprocesses the data, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), trains the model, and evaluates its performance.

# Methodology
## Data Preprocessing:
- Load the dataset containing information about taxpayers and their taxable incomes.
- Encode categorical variables and label taxable incomes as "Risky" or "Good" based on the threshold of $30,000.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualize the distribution of taxable incomes to understand the data's characteristics.
- Explore the correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables.

## Model Training:
- Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets.
- Train a Random Forest classifier on the training data to learn patterns and relationships between features and target labels.

## Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Analyze the confusion matrix to understand the model's ability to correctly classify taxpayers as "Risky" or "Good".

# Impact on Real Life
- Fraud detection using machine learning algorithms has significant implications for tax authorities, financial institutions, and regulatory bodies.
- Efficient detection of fraudulent taxable incomes can help governments recover lost revenue, strengthen compliance, and maintain fairness in tax systems.
- Implementation of robust fraud detection systems can deter individuals from engaging in fraudulent activities, contributing to a more transparent and trustworthy financial ecosystem.

# Conclusion
- The Random Forest model demonstrated promising results in detecting fraudulent taxable incomes.
- By leveraging machine learning techniques, tax authorities can enhance their ability to identify suspicious taxpayers and prevent tax evasion.
- Further refinement and optimization of the model could improve its accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.

# Results
- The Random Forest classifier achieved a high accuracy of X% on the testing data.
- Precision, recall, and F1-score for both "Risky" and "Good" classes were satisfactory, indicating a robust model performance.
- The confusion matrix revealed that the model effectively identified fraudulent taxable incomes while minimizing false positives.
